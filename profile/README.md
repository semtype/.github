### Semtype

**Semtype** is a standard for defining and discovering universally understandable types that can be used and composed by both people and machines.

Semtype was originally developed for use as part of the open-source, self-building **[HASH]** database and platform for high-trust AI.

Semtype is also compatible with the **[Block Protocol]** standard for composable user and AI-defined interfaces, and is the data representation at the heart of the **hgres** data engine.
